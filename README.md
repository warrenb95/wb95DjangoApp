# wb95DjangoApp

This Git repo is a personal project of mine. The project is a photography 
website used to share images as well as blog posts. The website also features
a contact page and links to various other sites.

The site is developed with Django and sqlite3.

To run on a new machine you need to migrate the database and create the super user.
